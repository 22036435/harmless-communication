            <h1>How to communicate/disseminate data within an oppressive authoritarian regime.</h2>
            <p>Inform and empower others to be able to communicate freely without risking the personal security of them or who they communicate with.<br>The idea is to create an experimental project to build a tool that is off-target because it seems irrelevant and does not require a deep-rooted infrastructure and an online connection,<br> to solve communication problems caused by government restrictions during protests or the lack of infrastructure during natural disasters and other related causes.<br>Whilst looking at the issues one may face with the rise of authoritarian regimes and the slow but eventual censorship of the internet,<br> we began looking at alternative yet existing modes of communication. Rather than creating a solution that already exists-<br> how could we bring light to this issue and help people better understand the tools they already have at their disposal?</p>
